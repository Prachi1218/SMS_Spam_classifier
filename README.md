# SMS_Spam_classifier
SMS spam classification is a common problem in natural language processing.
In python we can use various machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham.
First step is to data collection. After collecting the data we need to prepare it for further steps preprocessing the data and in this steps we cleaning the data, converting raw data into a useable format, tokenizing and vectorizing the text messages.
Then we can use techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF to represent the messages as numerical features.
Then the data is split into training and testing sets to train and evalute different machine learning models.
The model use in this project is Naive Bayes classfier.
Finally we can evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as precision,recall and F1 score. 
This process helps to improve the user experience by reducing the number of unwanted spam messages received.
